    <h1>Software I use</h1>
    <p>I like cool looking software. I also like productive software. These are my picks for a good middle ground.</p>
    <p>I may suggest a mix of both CLI and GUI based programs. If I am using mainly a terminal app, or the TTY, I use the CLI programs, but in a regular desktop I gravitiate generally toward the GUI.</p>
    <h2>Operating System</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt class="simple">
            Linux Distro - Arch Linux
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I love Linux - its fast, looks cool, and you can do anything you want, not restricted by Microsoft's BS.
            Arch Linux is a barebones Linux distribution that seems hard at first, but is simple to use day-to-day with an open mind.

            Desktop Enviroment
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I use GNOME since it's simple and looks quite nice when doing day-to-day work, but when coding I like to use Hyprland. You can find my basic Hyprland rice, along with all my other configurations <a href="https://github.com/Typhoonz0/archfr/">here</a>.

    <h2>Utilities</h2>
        <dt class="simple">
            Terminal
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I use Ghostty cause it's feature-rich, reliable, and looks nice out of the box.
        </dd>
        <dt class="simple">
            Code Editor
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I use VSCodium, an open-source fork of Microsoft's VSCode when creating large projects and Neovim for editing small configuration files. I've always liked the idea of ricing vim like all the tech YouTubers do, but I have no real interest of incorporating it into my workflow.
        </dd>
        <dt class="simple">
            Web Browser
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I use Firefox - it's highly customisable, privacy focused and has all the modern web browser features while still supporting 'Manifest V2' - a web standard that lets adblockers work to their fullest potential.
        </dd>
        <dt class="simple">
            File Explorer
        </dt>
        <dd>
            In a TTY, I use lf, otherwise Nautilus, the default in GNOME, is a great pick.
        </dd>
    <h2>Office/Productivity</h2>
    <dt class="simple">
        Office Applications
    </dt>
    <dd>
        I love LibreOffice - its the best Office suite cause it's not monitored by Microsoft and Onedrive isn't being a pain in the butt.
